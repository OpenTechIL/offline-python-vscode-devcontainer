### Git Flow

This project utilizes `git-flow` for its branching model, which helps organize development and release cycles. Please adhere to the following `git-flow` conventions:

*   **`develop` Branch:** This is the main development branch where all new features are integrated. `feature` branches are always merged into `develop`.
*   **`feature` Branches:** Use `git flow feature start <feature-name>` for new features. These branches should be based off `develop` and merged back into `develop`.
*   **`release` Branch:** This branch contains the official release history. Use `git flow release start <version>` when preparing a new release. These branches are based off `develop` and are merged into `release` (for official releases) and `develop` (to ensure feature parity).
*   **`hotfix` Branches:** Use `git flow hotfix start <hotfix-name>` for urgent bug fixes on `release`. These branches are based off `release` and merged into both `release` and `develop`.
*   **`bugfix` Branches:** Use `git flow bugfix start <bugfix-name>` for new bugfixes. These branches should be based off `develop` and merged back into `develop`.
